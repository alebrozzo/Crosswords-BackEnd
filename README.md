This piece of software is creatd to practice what was learnt from reading and researching about javascript in general and node in particular. It will later on be part of a portfoio-like repository and will include a way to graphically create the puzzle structure.
For now, it's just a learning start.


This repo contains the back end of my apps, mainly Node.js
